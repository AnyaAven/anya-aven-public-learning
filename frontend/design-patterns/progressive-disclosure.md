# Progressive Disclosure

---
Progressive disclosure is a design technique that involves showing users only 
essential information at first, while hiding more detailed or complex information 
until it’s needed. This approach keeps interfaces clean and minimizes information overload, 
making it easier for users to focus on the task at hand.

**Basic Information First:**
Show only the primary options or information that the user needs immediately.

**Secondary Information Later:** 
More detailed options or advanced settings are revealed as users need them, 
often through clickable links, icons, tooltips, or “More” buttons.

**On-Demand Expansion:** 
Users can click or tap to reveal additional information, settings, or explanations 
when they’re ready.
