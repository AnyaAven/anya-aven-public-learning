# Microinteractions

---
## Feedback
Giving users visual or auditory responses when they interact with an element 
(e.g., a button changes color when clicked).

## System Status
Showing the current status of a system or task, like a progress bar or loading spinner.

## Guidance
Helping users navigate by highlighting interactions 
(e.g., a small animation to show that a dropdown is opening).

## Preventing Mistakes
Adding confirmation steps or nudges 
(like shaking a login field when the password is incorrect).
