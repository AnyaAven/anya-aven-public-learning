# Empty States

---

A state that has no available data to show.

This state is often overlooked but can be a crucial step in design as
often this is one of the first views a user experiences!

# No Data
When there's no data to show, we should be thinking about what state
the user's experience is at.
This may lead to a call to action or playful commentary!

## Various states

### First Use
The empty state should help the users understand the flow of how they can
get their data displayed while keeping content short.
Try adding helpful messages or call to actions.
This should not replace a more in-depth onboarding experience.

### Starter Content
Content apps (similar to Procreate) it may be helpful to have a few pieces of 
starter content. Allowing the user to see what the app has to offer.

### Finished State 
This occurs when users complete actions such as clearing their inbox or task list, 
and the result is an empty screen.

### Best Match
If nothing matches the query, try showing possible matches.
