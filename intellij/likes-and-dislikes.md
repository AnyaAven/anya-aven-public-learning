### Database
Okay amazing, love to have this in my editor.

* DB connections
* DB Diagrams (that can be rearranged and exported!)

### Run / Debug Configurations

You can configure how you'd like to configure each run and debug operation!
Set up env variables as well.

Inside a markdown for a shell script you can just hit the play button.
