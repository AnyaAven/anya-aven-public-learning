## Basics of Git

---
### Switch / New Branch 
Flag: `-c` or `--create` to create a new branch.
```shell
git switch -c NEW_BRANCH_NAME
```

#### Checkout
This will also switch you to a branch and is more versatile than switch 
but not having as much clarity. Switch is newer!
```shell
git checkout BRANCH NAME
```

Push to repo
```shell
git push origin NEW_BRANCH_NAME
```
