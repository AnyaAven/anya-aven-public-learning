# Meetings

Here are some thoughts about meetings in software engineering

### "I thought it was just me."
Engineers seem unconfident to bring up bugs and errors as issue based on "I thought it was just me."

At the same time, bogging the meeting with issues that are only local issues should be avoided
as its very costly for meetings.

Issues should involve as much detail as possible. Network, console, etc,. messages.
