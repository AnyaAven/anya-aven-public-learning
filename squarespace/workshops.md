# Squarespace

---

## When do you use it?

Squarespace has a place for small startups with common problems.
It has a wide range of customizability while being approachable to the average user.

There's a lot of great how-to tutorials and documentation on the website.

## Can you code with it?

You can insert code snippets! I have yet to play around with them but you can add
advanced features.
It also has places to add HTML and Markdown.

# Workshops
Working with a client, I combined their products and events pages into one workshop page.

This fixed the UX that didn't connect /events to /register. 
It was unclear that both were the same thing.

In the events detail page it only held the description, location, and time.
It needed an "add to cart" button which was added with a product insert.
